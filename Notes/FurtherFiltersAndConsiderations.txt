After ranking, we sort by high book-to-market ratio. We want semi-strict filters on size. Finding mispriced firms is harder for larger firms. Thus, the bottom 2/3 of market cap is recommended. Further more, it is harder to capitalize on mispricings of popular stocks with high volume. Thus, we try to get medium to low volume stocks. It also seems as though firms taht were previously ranked in medium financial distress benefit most from fundamental analysis, in terms of return.
