We seek to have all these expressions larger than 0.
In all cases, assets are taken to be at the start of the period, other values at the end.
we define 
	dx 	 = x_t - x_(t-1);
	logd(x)  = dx/x - 1;
	Elogd(x) = x_t/Ex_t - 1; where Ex_t = 0.5*(x_(t-1) + x_(t-2))
	Md(x)    = x - m(x); where m(x) is the competing firm mean

Comments: In this list we have the following identities:
		- Sales = Revenues or Operating Revenue.

%% Prior Tiered List %%
# S-Tier (weight 1)
RoA 		= NBID_t/A_(t-1) [NBID is net income before taxes, interest and depcriciation, and A is assets.
d(RoA) 		= increase in return on assets
CFO 		= Positive cash flow from operations

# A-Tier (weight 0.75)
m(B/M) 		= higher book-to-market ratio relative to market
d(GM/A) 	= increase in gross margins over assets ratio.
m(FCF/mktCap)   = Free Cash flow to market cap
m(GN/P) 	= Grahams number to price

# B-Tier (weight 0.5)
d(RoTA) 	= increase in return on tangible assets
-(Elogd(I) - Elogd(S)) 	= decrease in deviation of Inventory less deviation of Sales. [or d(S) - d(I)>0]
d(S/A) 		= increase in sales over assets ratio [Asset turnover]
d(CFO/mktCap)   = Higher than average cash flow from operations as a ratio of market capitalization.
GNN 		= Positive grahams netnet
CFO/E -1		= operating_cashflow higher than net income

# C-Tier (weight 0.3)
dCurrent ratio  = d(CurrentAssets/CurrentLiabilities)
dRoEq 		= increase in return on equity
d(GM/S) 	= increase in gross profit over sales ratio
-dT 		= decrease in effective taxes 
m(S/mktCap)     = above average sale over market capitalization
d(FCF/Eq)	= increase in free cash flow over equity
m(E/P)		= Higher than average earnings per price (earnings yield)


# D-Tier (weight 0.1)
-dLtD/A 	= decrease in the ratio (long term debt/Assets). [Or d(A/LtD) > 0]
d(ROI)[ROIC?]   = Return on Investment (income time t, investment t-1)
d(GM)		= increase in gross margin
-m(D/E)		= less Dept-Equity ratio than average
d(E/P*EG)	= d(Earnings/Price)*d(Earnings)


# Unsable-Tier (weight 0)


# Add probably later Tier
logd(S/L) 	= (Sales_t/Labour_t)/(Sales_(t-1)/Labour_(t-1)) - 1;
-d(SO)		= decrease(non-increase) in shares outstanding
dE 		= increase in equity 
E(NOA)		= positive net operating assets relative to expectations
d(NOA)		= increase in net operating assets
m(FCF) 		= Free Cash flow.
d(E/Share)	= Increase in earnings per share
ElogD(S) 	= deviation in sales (operating revenue?)


#Unkown-Tier
d(bV)
P/E * P/BV - 22.5 ( Warren Buffet rule)
(P/E + P/BV*10)/15 - 1 (Warren Buffet rule variant) 
m(E/mktCap)	= above average earnings over market capitalization
Elogd(CapEx)    = deviation of capital expenditures.
Elogd(S)-Elogd(OE) 	= devation of sales less deviation in operating expenses 
CFO/A - ROA     = Cash flow from operations higher than net income less interest taxes and depriciation.
P/E 		= Price/Earnings
dividend yield 
dOC/S 		= dOperatingCost - dSales
Elogd(AR) 	= deviation in Accounts recievable.
dAR -dS		= dAccountReceivables - dSales.
